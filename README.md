# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (JavaScript)

A simple and interactive number guessing game built with JavaScript using `prompt()` and `console.log()`. The user selects a maximum number range and tries to guess the randomly generated number within that range.

## ðŸš€ Features

- User-defined number range
- Random number generation
- Real-time guessing with feedback
- Option to quit the game anytime

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. The game asks the user to input a **maximum number** (e.g., 50).
2. A **random number** is generated between `1` and the given max.
3. The user is then prompted to guess the number.
4. After each guess:
   - If correct, the game congratulates the user and ends.
   - If too low or too high, the user is prompted again.
   - The user can type `"quit"` anytime to exit the game.

## ðŸ’» Code Example

```js
const max = prompt("How much the number to guessing range");
const number = Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + 1;
let guessing = prompt("Guess the number");

while (true) {
  if (guessing == "quit") {
    console.log("Quit the game");
    break;
  }

  if (guessing == number) {
    console.log("Your guess is right! Congrats! Random number was:", number);
    break;
  } else if (guessing < number) {
    guessing = prompt("Your guess was wrong and too small. Please try again");
  } else {
    guessing = prompt("Your guess was wrong and too large. Please try again");
  }
}

ðŸ“‚ How to Run
Create an index.html file.

Link your JavaScript file or paste the code directly inside a <script> tag.

Open the HTML file in your browser.

ðŸ“Œ Note
This game runs in the browser and uses the prompt() and console.log() functions, so open your developer console to view the results (F12 â†’ Console tab).
